Burn. by Smizzle.  Elune. Mostly Harmless.

Why?

Because we like to see things burn.  This mod was written for the purpose of helping us have more
control over our ignites.  It does this by supplying information from the game about the ignite 
event.  Using this you can, for example, time that all important fire blast when the ignite is about
to roll off.  Hopefully it crits...  Also available is info about the owner, the tick and the total.
Your remaining combustions are shown, and other mages popping it near you cause Burn to glow.
Nearby fire crits cause Burn to flash; this is important when the stack reaches 5 ( discussed below ).
And finally, there is a warning system in place so that if you near tank threat levels, you can send 
a warning to other mages to STOP! FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY!

You should know...

Drag the mod by R-clicking in the info window when maximized, in the timer area when minimized.

Any mage fire crits will cause Burn to flash.  If the owner of the ignite crits, Burn explodes.

R-Clicking the top left button cycles the info window ( regular display, highest ticks, highest totals ).

Burn only shows info for your target.

Burn will set you message log distance to 50 meters.  


When the stack reaches 5...

Sadly, there are no more messages sent to us by the game at this point that tell us how to resync the timer.
The solution Burn uses is to let you know that (a) the target is still ignited, and (b) someone else has just
crit with a fire spell.  So at 5 stacks, you can expect to see that Burn is still lit up (target ignited), and
periodic flashing (target crit with fire), but the timer is no longer active.  Also, "BURN" will be displayed
in the timer area.

Hope you enjoy...
