Welcome to Inject Time!

This is a simple timer application intended to provide an audial cue for timings related to Starcraft II (such as the "inject Larvae" ability). 

It is not recommended to use this application as a substitute for a good sense of timing, however you may find it useful to improve your own timing by using this application for practise. Aim to always "know" that you should inject *BEFORE* the application tells you to. When you have achieved this, you have improved an important macro mechanic in Starcraft II, congratulations.

Inject Time must be manually (or autostart) started before you are able to activate it - then you can easely start the audio cues by using a hotkey. The default hotkeys are Ctrl+i to start a cycle (giving a cue each 32(62) seconds) or reset the cycle, and ctrl+k to stop the application and give no further audial alerts. If you press Ctrl+i while Starcraft II is not your active window, you should be taken to the Settings GUI, where you can change mechanic-to-track to MULE or Chronoboost, change hotkeys and slightly adjust the timer. Use with caution though, as any offset will increase over time as you complete more cycles. If you want to reset the settings to "standard", simply delet the Settings.ini file. 

I hope that you will find this application useful, and more importantly - that you will manage to improve your own game sense!

If you found the application useful, please send me feedback using the included "Feedback" function (rightclick the tray icon to get the menu choice) - your appreciation is all I get for my free work.

DISCLAIMER:

This application does in no way interact with Starcraft II, and should thus not break any EULA or Battle.net rules. It is simply a clock with a regular alarm that plays in the background on your computer. However - even if Inject Time should not break any terms, use it at your own risk. I bear no responsibility. It is not recommended to use for competative play, and also keep in mind that some gamers might find it "unfair play" to use tools such as this in gaming.

If you choose to update the application, you will be downloading InjectTime.exe from a trusted server, if available. Nothing will be downloaded without your permission (except for the version number).  

PATCH NOTES:

0.9: Clan Alpha.
0.91: Added sounds and option to select Beep/Simple/Voice-sounds. Also added an update function that will download an update if a new version is available. The timer adjustment is still broken.
0.92: Improved the update-function. Fixed bugs so voice should now work as intended, always.
0.94: Added a header, some graphical elements. Changed to clicksound. Added "Feedback", and changed upload to work off Autohotkey.net.
